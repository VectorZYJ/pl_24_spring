To use terminal to make file and generate executable file 'hw-checker', 

1. 'cd' to current directory
2. Type 'make' and then enter
3. Executable file 'hw-checker' could be found in this directory



To test this 'hw-checker', you could:

either follow the format './hw-checker FILENAME' in terminal to start this executable 'hw-checker' and parse a file for checking (Attention: file must end with a new line).

or just type './hw-checker' for directly inputting expressions in command line for testing.
